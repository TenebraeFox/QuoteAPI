# QuoteAPI
QuoteAPI is a simple and efficient RESTful API for managing quotes, built using FastAPI. It allows users to fetch random quotes, add new quotes, update existing quotes, and delete quotes. The quotes are stored in an SQLite3 database, and the API ensures secure modifications through token-based authentication.
